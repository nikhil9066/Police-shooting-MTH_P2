THE ISSUES:
Within the field of data science and advanced statistics, our attention is drawn to the major issue of
fatal police shootings in the United States. By utilizing the information obtained from the Washington
Post, our research is ready to discover knowledge. Our goal is to provide detailed, data-driven
knowledge of this crucial problem in society that goes beyond traditional news headlines by
analyzing complex trends and identifying significant causes.
The dataset in question contains a wide range of features, including important attributes like gender,
armed, race, state, body camera, and signs of mental illness.
We address the questions:
● There are several missing values in the data; how to deal with the missing values
● What steps are we taking to address the race column's missing values?
● How should we approach the race column's issue in the future (if new data comes in)?
● What are the trends in police shootings within California?
● How can we understand regional trends contributing to the target?
● The probability of a Male being shot in different races.
● Was there any bias when there was a body cam on any race?
