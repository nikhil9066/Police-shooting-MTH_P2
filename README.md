# Police Shooting Analysis - Project Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the Police Shooting Analysis project repository. In the realm of data science and advanced statistics, our focus is on addressing the critical issue of fatal police shootings in the United States. Leveraging data from the Washington Post, our research aims to uncover insights that extend beyond traditional news headlines. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, data-driven understanding of this societal problem by analyzing complex trends and identifying significant contributing factors.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset we are working with encompasses a diverse set of features, including key attributes such as gender, armament, race, state, body camera usage, and signs of mental illness.

## Key Questions
Our analysis tackles several key questions:

1. **Handling Missing Values:**
   - How do we address the numerous missing values in the dataset?
   
2. **Race Column:**
   - What steps are being taken to handle missing values in the race column?
   - How should we approach potential missing values in the race column in future datasets?

3. **Regional Trends:**
   - What are the trends in police shootings within California?
   - How can regional trends contribute to understanding the overall target?

4. **Gender and Race Probability:**
   - What is the probability of a male being shot in different racial groups?

5. **Body Camera Bias:**
   - Was there any observed bias when a body camera was present, particularly concerning different racial groups?

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

- **Data Cleaning:** Addresses missing values and preprocesses the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Explores trends and patterns in the data.
- **Regional Analysis:** Focuses on police shootings within California.
- **Gender and Race Analysis:** Examines the probability of males being shot in different racial groups.
- **Body Camera Bias Analysis:** Investigates potential bias related to body camera usage.

Feel free to explore each section to gain a deeper understanding of our analysis and findings.

Thank you for joining us on this journey to shed light on a critical issue through the lens of data science.
